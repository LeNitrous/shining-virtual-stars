# Shining Virtual Stars
This is a joke game made in 48 hours to take jabs at the community asking for a hololive-themed rhythm game.

## Building
### Prerequisites
- .NET 5.0 SDK installed.

### Running locally
- `dotnet run --project  Hololive.Game`

Although the game can be run on Android and iOS, I have only prepared a Desktop project for this game. Meaning this can also be run on Linux and MacOS.

## Credits

- **[成海七海/Narumi-Nanami](https://twitter.com/naru_quadrille)** for the character art used throughout the experience.
- **[osu!framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework)** which the game runs on.
- **Amatuerre** and **[sr229](https://github.com/sr229)** for input and feedback.
